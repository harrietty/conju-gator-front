    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>
      Like most website operators, Conju&#8208;Gator collects
      non&#8208;personally&#8208;identifying information of the sort that web
      browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
      language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
      request. Conju&#8208;Gator&apos;s purpose in collecting
      non&#8208;personally identifying information is to better understand how
      Conju&#8208;Gator&apos;s visitors use its website. From time to time,
      Conju&#8208;Gator may release non&#8208;personally&#8208;identifying
      information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in
      the usage of its website.
    </p>
    <h2>Gathering of Personally&#8208;Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>
      Certain visitors to Conju&#8208;Gator&apos;s websites choose to sign in to
      Conju&#8208;Gator. In this instance, Conju&#8208;Gator will request access
      to personally identifying information such as your name, in order to
      provide a personalised experience. Conju&#8208;Gator does not store this
      information.
    </p>

    <p>
      The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember
      that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
      storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable
      means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
      absolute security.
    </p>
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Conju&#8208;Gator uses &quot;Cookies&quot; to track your session, so you

      visitor&apos;s computer, and that the visitor&apos;s browser provides to
      the website each time the visitor returns. Conju&#8208;Gator uses cookies
      to help Conju&#8208;Gator identify and track visitors, their usage of
